# St3llar Sat-1 Boira Team Public Repository

Welcome to the CubeSat Team's Public GitHub Repository! This repository is your gateway to exploring our journey in the world of CubeSat development, space exploration, and engineering.

## About Project Stellar Sat-1 Boira

**Stellar Sat-1 Boira** is the first student CubeSat of the **Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M)**, a public Spanish university founded in 1989. The student CubeSat program started in September 2022, and it is integrated in UC3Mâ€™s **Master in Space Engineering (MISE)**.

The aim of Boira is to design, integrate, validate, launch, and operate a **2U CubeSat** to **monitor local climate change** by **measuring atmospheric moisture**; with the primary goal being **educational** (all tasks are performed by UC3M graduate students), and secondary goals related to **technology demonstration** and **science**. 

## About Us

We are a passionate and dedicated group of individuals, mostly students and professors of **UC3M**, driven by a shared vision of exploring space, conducting scientific experiments, and advancing CubeSat technology. Our mission is to foster education and innovation while contributing to the global space community.

## What is CubeSat?

A CubeSat is a type of miniaturized satellite that provides a low-cost and accessible means for scientific research, technology demonstrations, and educational opportunities. These small satellites are standardized in size, typically a 10x10x10 cm cube, and can be launched into space as auxiliary payloads on larger rockets.

## Our Goals

Our team is committed to:

- Designing, building, and **launching a CubeSat** for **scientific** and **educational** purposes.
- Conducting experiments and research in the fields of Earth science, and telecommunications, focusing on local climate change monnitoring.
- Promoting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education and inspiring the next generation of space enthusiasts.

## What You'll Find in Our Repository

In the near future, our intention is to progressively enhance the accessibility of this repository by officially incorporating comprehensive project documentation and software/code. However, in its current state, you will discover the following categories of content:

- **Educational Materials**: Resources designed to educate and inspire, including guides, tutorials, and outreach materials.
- **News & Media Gallery**: Photos, videos, and news showcasing our team's activities and achievements throughout our learning experience..
- **Dissemination**: Posters and articles used at conferences/journals as well as **MISE** technical reports and thesis.
